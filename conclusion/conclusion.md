# My conclusions about stackOverflow survey 2022 

---

## Who adding a code to stackOverflow? 

![plot](/conclusion/plots/howUsersDescribeThemselves.png)

Most of the people are a developer by profession, 1,8% of people used to be a programmer and 8,6% are still learning how to code.

## Programmers' specializations


![plot](/conclusion/plots/specialization.png)

Most of programmers work as a full-stack developer. Data scientists are in the middle of the plot. Crypto currency and web3 was popular in 2022 but Blockchain developers are in the bottom of the list.

## Degree of programmers

The plot shows what degree programmers have. Most of them have Bachelor's degree, at the second place is Master's degree. Only small part of them has PhD.

Also most of blockchain developers have Bachelor's degree, but number of them having master's degree is lower similar to PhD.

Frontend developers have definitely lower degree than data scientists and machine learning developers, but simillar to blockchain developers

## From where developers work

Most of developers eather work fully remote or in hibrid mode. Only small part on programmers work fylly in pesron

In case of data scientists and machine learning developers, most of theam work in hybrid mode. Compared to average, fewer of theam wrok fully remote. But the percentage of working full in person is simillar

## Programming languages

![normal](/conclusion/plots/languagesUsedByDevelopers.png)

Most of developers use js, unfortunately c++ is on 9th place. there is 11 languages used by more than 20 percent of developers.

![normal](/conclusion/plots/languagesDevelopersWantToUse.png)

Most of developers want to learn js and python. Top 5 languages have much more interest than other. 17% of developers want to learn c++.

![normal](/conclusion/plots/mergedPlots.png)

Plot is showing difference between how many programmers want to learn specific language and how many of them use it. We can find out which of language communitis will grow in next years, and which will shrink. Almost twice more programmers want to use rust than used it.
